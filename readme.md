# CaptionBee

Free Tool to help with embedding ClosedCaptions into Livestreams 
This is created out of Frustration about the current state of Tools and especially their Pricing, especially for embedded Captions.



## Setup
You will need to have the following : 
Streamtext Account / Event ID
OBS installed
Web sockets enabled

## Usage
    
Configure Config.json with :
Enable captions within OBS
Run the EXE ( see releases here )
Type / Caption Away in Streamtext

## Alternative
AcessLopp
EEG Falcon
SyncWords

## Roadmap
Directly Ingest Captions locally instead of going through StresmText
Group text together and use a small delay
Testmode that sends Text for testing
Control OBS streaming so that this all can be packed into Docker for Headless usage

## Aknowledges
